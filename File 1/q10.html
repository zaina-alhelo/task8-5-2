   <h2><u>What is the introduction of math ?</u></h2> 
   <p>Mathematics,<mark> the science of structure, order, and relation</mark> that has evolved from elemental practices of counting, measuring, 
    and describing the shapes of objects. It deals with logical reasoning and quantitative calculation, 
    and its development has involved an increasing degree of idealization and abstraction of its subject matter. </p>
    
    <p>This does not mean, however, that developments elsewhere have been unimportant. Indeed, to understand <b>the history of mathematics </b><u>in Europe,
         it is necessary to know its history at least in ancient</u><mark> Mesopotamia and Egypt</mark>,
          in ancient Greece,<u>and in Islamic civilization from the 9th to the 15th century.</u> </p>

    <h2><u>introduction of chemistry</u></h2>
    <p><mark>chemistry</mark>man has been <u>exposed to changing surroundings ever since he came into existence.</u> 
        He has been quite <b>interested in learning </b>about his surroundings and studying and explaining the things that are happening around him. 
       <mrak><u> He has conducted experiments and observations to gather information as a result of his interest.</u></mrak> Through the decades, 
        it has also been in charge of many peoples research endeavours around the globe.</p>      
        <p><del>Systematizing and organising the knowledge acquired </del>in this way was absolutely necessary for the<mark> good </mark>of humanity.</p>
